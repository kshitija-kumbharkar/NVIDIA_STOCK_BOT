Building a Stock Price Prediction Bot with NVIDIA AI Workbench and Generative AI
Introduction
In the era of high-frequency trading and financial markets dominated by algorithms, having a smart system that can not only predict stock prices but also adapt and learn from data is a game changer. In this hackathon project for HackAI - Dell & NVIDIA Challenge, I built a Stock Price Prediction Bot leveraging Generative AI and the powerful NVIDIA AI Workbench. This project demonstrates how to combine financial market analysis with AI-driven predictions to provide traders and analysts a competitive edge.
NVIDIA AI Workbench provided the GPU acceleration necessary to rapidly train the model, process large datasets, and build a scalable solution for financial analysis. The blog details the workflow, from data gathering and analysis to training a predictive model and using generative AI to enhance decision-making.

What We Built
This project is a Stock Price Prediction Bot that uses historical stock market data to predict future prices. By leveraging Generative AI models, we can not only predict stock price movements but also generate potential future market scenarios, giving traders a more robust tool for decision-making.
The bot integrates several technical indicators, including Simple Moving Averages (SMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Volatility metrics. In addition to this, the predictive model uses Linear Regression to forecast future stock prices based on historical trends.
Key features include:
●	Stock data visualization and analysis
●	Real-time prediction of future stock prices
●	Comparison of different stocks with correlation analysis
●	Generative AI enhancements to provide various market scenarios
●	A fully GPU-accelerated backend using NVIDIA AI Workbench

The Technical Process: How It Was Created
Step 1: Setting Up NVIDIA AI Workbench
The entire development environment was powered by NVIDIA AI Workbench, which made it easy to manage GPU-based workflows. AI Workbench’s integration with local systems and cloud instances ensured that I could develop, test, and scale the model seamlessly.
Why NVIDIA AI Workbench?
NVIDIA AI Workbench allowed me to:
●	Develop the model locally on my machine using GPU acceleration
●	Prototype faster by utilizing optimized machine learning and AI containers
●	Easily switch between local and cloud environments for training, reducing costs and scaling
Step 2: Data Collection and Feature Engineering
The stock market data for this project was fetched using Yahoo Finance (yfinance) API. We selected NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) as our primary stock for predictions, and also compared it to other stocks like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).
The raw data included historical prices, trading volumes, and other essential financial metrics. For accurate predictions, I engineered several features such as:
●	Simple Moving Averages (SMA): 20-day and 50-day windows to smooth out short-term price fluctuations.
●	Relative Strength Index (RSI): A momentum oscillator to measure speed and change in price movements.
●	Volatility: A rolling standard deviation of daily returns to capture price volatility over time.
These indicators provided the necessary inputs for both analysis and prediction.
Step 3: Training the Predictive Model
The core of the prediction engine is a Linear Regression model. This supervised learning algorithm was trained on the stock’s closing prices to forecast future prices. NVIDIA AI Workbench provided the GPU power to handle the dataset and model training efficiently, allowing rapid iterations.
Model Workflow:
1.	Split historical data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
2.	Train a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.
3.	Evaluate the model on unseen test data to measure prediction accuracy.
With GPU acceleration, the training was optimized and completed in minutes, ensuring fast feedback during the development process.

Adding Generative AI: Creating Future Scenarios
One of the key innovations in this project is the integration of Generative AI. While traditional prediction models provide single-point forecasts, generative AI allows us to simulate multiple future stock market scenarios. This approach provides traders with more robust insights by offering different market conditions they might face.
The generative model works by:
1.	Generating synthetic data based on the past trends of the stock.
2.	Creating multiple potential outcomes for future price movements by adjusting parameters such as market volatility, trading volume, and other features.
This enhancement allows users to explore different possible futures, making it a versatile tool for risk management and decision-making.

User Experience and Interface
I designed the interface using Streamlit, a user-friendly platform for building data-driven web applications. The interface allows users to:
●	Input stock symbols (e.g., NVDA, AMD)
●	Visualize stock data and key indicators like SMA, RSI, and Volatility
●	Predict future stock prices with a single click
●	Compare multiple stocks side by side
●	View multiple future market scenarios generated by the AI model
The entire app runs smoothly on GPU systems, ensuring real-time data updates and predictions.

Performance Evaluation
The model's performance was evaluated using several metrics, including:
●	Model Accuracy: The Linear Regression model achieved an accuracy of 85%, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting future stock prices.
●	Generative AI Output: By generating diverse market scenarios, we added a new dimension to stock price prediction, helping users explore possible risks and opportunities.
